# DMX >> NeoPixel

## Why
Do you want to pretend your giant DMX lamps are NeoPixels? Do you not want to think about DMX and just use your beloved neopixel patterns on your stage lighting or gigantic art? This code uses Adafruit Neopixel style structure so you can just copy/paste existing patterns onto DMX lights. 

## What You'll Need
This uses the [DF Robot DMX Shield](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-984.html) to control standard 4 or 8 channel [DMX lights](https://www.amazon.com/Lights-MFL-Lighting-Activated-Wedding/dp/B01CTU89N8/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&qid=1541910731&sr=8-17&keywords=RGBW+dmx) You'll also need an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) which the shield fits on top of. Note: You can't use Serial while using DMX lights.
